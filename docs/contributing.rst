Contributing Guide
==================

The goal of Wagtail SEO is to become the most complete, go-to package for doing
SEO on Wagtail. This means it will not only provide the features, but will
continually stay up to date with evolving SEO practices and data standards (and
Google's whims).

That being said we heartily welcome contributions!

Bugs, feature requests, and ideas should be opened first as a `GitHub issue
<https://github.com/coderedcorp/wagtail-seo/issues>`_. Pull requests will be
accepted provided they meet the project's quality standards, and can be
demonstrated to align with a published SEO or data standard.

Development Environment
-----------------------

To set up your development environment:

#. Create a new environment (in a ``.venv`` folder)

   .. code-block:: shell

       python -m venv .venv

       # Mac and Linux
       source ./.venv/bin/activate

       # Windows (PowerShell)
       ./.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1

#. Enter the source code directory and install the package locally with
   additional development tools

   .. code-block:: shell

      pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

#. Write some code.

#. Next, run the static analysis tools

   .. code-block:: shell

      ruff format .
      ruff check --fix .
      codespell .
      mypy ./wagtailseo/

#. Next, run the units tests. A simple Wagtail project using Wagtail SEO is
   in the ``testproject/`` directory. The tests will also generate a code
   coverage report at ``htmlcov/index.html``, which you can open in your browser

   .. code-block:: shell

      pytest ./testproject/


Documentation
-------------

To build the documentation, run the following, which will output to the
``docs/_build/html/`` directory

.. code-block:: shell

   sphinx-build -M html ./docs/ ./docs/_build/ -W


Publishing
----------

To create a python package, run the following, which will output the package to
the ``dist/`` directory. Be sure to first delete any existing build caches, as
those could include files from other builds and create broken wheels.

.. code-block:: shell

   python -m build
