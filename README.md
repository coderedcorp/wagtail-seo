CJKCMS Wagtail SEO
===========

Project forked from [https://github.com/coderedcorp/wagtail-seo](Wagtail SEO) to add support for Wagtail 5 and upcoming Wagtail 6.
Original project is still at Wagtail 4 compatibility, making it unusable with [https://github.com/cjkpl/wagtail-cjkcms.git](CJKCMS).

Package name is left without change (`wagtailseo`), so it can be used as drop-in replacement for original package.

===========

Search engine and social media optimization for Wagtail.

The goal of Wagtail SEO is to become the most complete, go-to package for doing
SEO on Wagtail. This means it will not only provide the features, but will
continually stay up to date with evolving SEO practices and data standards (and
Google's whims). That being said we heartily welcome contributions!
